OpenSat is a SOTA satellite network framework built for Space Intelligence.

OpenSat is **powerful for network research**:

- Network metrics like latency, throughput and dynamic topology changes.
- Evaluate end-to-end network performance under various mobility scenarios.
- Test with new protocols and architectures specifically designed for LEO Networks.

OpenSat can **interact with multiple open-source frameworks**:

- [UERANSIM](): simulate realistic UE and gNodeB behavior, constructing 5G RAN.
- [Open5GS](): simulate satellite core network, focus on mobility management.
- [Dash.js](): test real-world application performance and Quality of Experience (QoE).

OpenSat is focus on **SatelliteNet applications and underlying network systems**.

- Analyze performance and behavior of satellite-network applications.
- Investigate and optimize core network functions in dynamic satellite environments.
- Facilitate cross-layer design to the underlying satellite network infra.

### Ready to go now?

Refer to the [quickstart guide](./ch1_quick_start.md) for initial local environment deployment and baseline testing procedures.

### Take a deep look?

OpenSat is an open-source satellite network service framework built on Open5GS, focusing on mobility management for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks.

OpenSat is inspired and based on [open5gs v2.7.4](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/releases/tag/v2.7.5)

Here are some roadmaps for you to start:

1. See [Quick Start](./ch1_quick_start.md) for a simple init.
2. Ensure you know how to use [basic tools](./ch2_net_tool.md) for networked research.
3. Take a whole look for [opensat system architecture](../doc/ch0_arch.md).

Then, please see [opensat-doc](../doc/ch0_arch.md) to learn how to conduct experiments for diverse environments.

### What's More?

To learn more, please refer to [OpenSat blog]().
